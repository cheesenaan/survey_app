        <li>  <b>  Sensing</b> : When a person is reserved and does not open up easily <br>  </li>
        <li>   <b>  Intuition </b> : When a person is social, talkative and makes friends quickly  </li>
        <li>   <b>  Example </b> : I can only collect information when I detect or sense something through the 5 senses. I cannot collect information intuitively, ie without seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling or touching something. Therefore, my collection of information group is Sensing and is not Intuition.   </li>

        <p>
            We are Sensing when we:
        </p>

        <li> Taste food </li>
        <li> Notice a stoplight has changed </li>
        <li> Memorize a speech </li>
        <li> Follow steps in a plan </li>
        
        <br>

        <p>
            We are introverting when we:
        </p>

        <li> Come up with a new way of doing things </li>
        <li> Think about future implications for a current action  </li>
        <li> Perceive underlying meaning in what people say or do        </li>
        <li> See the big picture </li>
        
        <br>
        <p>
            Do you rely on your five senses and want concrete, practical data to work with? Or do you trust your intuitions without necessarily building upon a solid foundation of facts?
